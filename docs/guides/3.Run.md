Start service
-------------

You must start your service with a daemonized (```-d```) version. This way you could later this container gracefully rather than sending a brutal SIGKILL

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```


Stop service
-------------

If you stop your container, sxapi application will be shutdown gracefully. All resources and connections established by you instance will be closed before exit.

```bash
docker-compose stop
```

Kill service
------------

When killing you container, docker send a SIGKILL signal to the container. This signal cause termination of the process, making it impossible to capture and make a clean stop of the server. You should avoid killing your container and prefer the operation of stopping and removing them.

```bash
docker-compose kill
# or better
docker-compose stop && docker-compose rm
```

------------

```bash
wget http://localhost:8080/ 
```
